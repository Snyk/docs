title: Authentication
---

Some Snyk commands require authentication. We use GitHub for authentication, but **do not require access to your repositories**, only your email address. You can authenticate by running `snyk auth` in your terminal, and it'll guide you through this process. 

Alternatively, you can visit [your account](https://snyk.io/account), copy your token and paste it into your terminal as follows:

```bash
snyk auth <your token>
```
