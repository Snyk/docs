Our Jira integration allows you to raise issues for vulnerabilities or license issues in Snyk. Itâ€™s available to all our Pro and Enterprise customers. Our integration includes an API ([see our API docs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/project-jira-issues)), and a way to manually raise a Jira issue in the UI (documented here).

**If your Jira instance is private, you'll need to get set up with [our broker](https://snyk.io/docs/snyk-broker) first, and then follow our [brokered Jira setup instructions](https://snyk.io/docs/snyk-broker#jira-setup).**
